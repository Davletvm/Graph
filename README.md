# Graph

Simple program that create graph from file.
first line in file is number of vertex.
all other include imformation about vervex. like with which other vertex the connected


in connected file lie two include such information "1,2".
it means that from vertex 0 exist way to vertex 1 and vertex 2.
this is not oriented graph, so this lines means that vertex 1 has a way to vertex 0 and vertex 2 has a way to vertex 0.
